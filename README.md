# TestingHstore

In a attempt to see if I could have a basic key value store via hstore with phoenix I ran into an issue where I could not get the expected values from the form. I'm saving this as an example of how I attempted to solve this problem.

Note the use of `normalize_list` in the post controller to address the fact I could not get the array of maps as I initially wanted.
